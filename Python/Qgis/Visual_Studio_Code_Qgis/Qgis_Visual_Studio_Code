Here I explain how configure Visual Studio Code for running alone scripts in Python that executes funcions of Qgis.

In the file "Visual_Studio_Code_Qgis\Work_Space_Configuration.code-workspace" is my file configuration that set the envoirment of operatig system.

With this configuration if you run your aplication from Visual Studio code there will be no errors with Python and Qgis.

For use this information:
    1.- Goto to the configuration of workspace (Control+)
    2.- Select workspace
    3.- In right upper square click to Open Configuration Json
    4.- Paste my code insight changing Directories.

In my configuration file I have a envoirment, if you don't want or don't have, delete the last lines.

This do the same like file "C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.12\bin\python-qgis.bat".

So if you run this file in CMD, and after that in the same CMD window, you write "set" and enter, you will have a list with the configuration of your system.
