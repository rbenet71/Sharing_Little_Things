App with :

- Yo can write your APP with differents Graphics User Interface, like Tkinter, Kivy or QT, and you only have to change the graphic part.
- The user off App can decide the language of app, using QT functions. (For this yo need to create a qm file. Using Translate.bat you can do it)
- You can design your GUI with QT Designer and make an .UI file.
- With Convert_UI_to_Py.bat you can convert your .UI file in a PY. file.
- In your code you decide if GUI load a .UI file or a .PY file.
- For me when your are developing the APP is better because yo don't need to transform.
- When you finish your app and you want to compile is better .PY file
